#Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list.

# List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Initialize a variable to store the sum
total = 0

# Iterate through each number in the list
for number in numbers:
    # Add the current number to the total
    total += number

# Print the total sum
print("The sum of the list is:", total)


#Output:- The sum of the list is: 15
